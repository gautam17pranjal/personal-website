                    I consider myself to be all-around, constantly experimenting in numerous domains. Since I was in school,
                    I've been involved in a variety of sports, traveling across India to compete in events.
                    It fostered a fresh appreciation of travel in me. While taking long train trips,
                    I find the scenic views of mountains, valleys, and plains to be fascinating.

                    I'm an engineer and a programmer, and I adore consistency, quality, order, and structure.
                    I enjoy being a part of a team that fosters growth for everyone, including myself.
                    It's true what they say: "Two heads are better than one!"
                    My friends describe me as diligent, tenacious, focused, hard-working, disciplined, and other like things.
                    Never, however, rely on what they say. Reach out to me to see for yourself.

                    I enjoy discussing about sports, TV shows, gaming, comics, and other topics with people from different cultures and backgrounds.
                    I enjoy watching movies, dramas, and television shows.
                    I've started exploring with cooking creating foods, which typically turn out well and sometimes :|

                    I am pleased with what I have accomplished so far and intend to bring discoveries and experiences to my life art.
